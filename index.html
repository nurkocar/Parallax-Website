        <h2>What is mindfulness?</h2><br>
        <p>Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we’re doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around us. While mindfulness is something we all naturally possess, it’s more readily
            available to us when we practice on a daily basis. Whenever you bring awareness to what you’re directly experiencing via your senses, or to your state of mind via your thoughts and emotions, you’re being mindful. And there’s growing research
            showing that when you train your brain to be mindful, you’re actually remodeling the physical structure of your brain.

        <h2>How do I practice mindfulness?</h2><br>
        <p>Mindfulness is available to us in every moment, whether through meditations and body scans, or mindful moment practices like taking time to pause and breathe when the phone rings instead of rushing to answer it.

        <h2>The Basics of Mindfulness Practice</h2><br>
        <p>1. <u>Set aside some time</u>. You don’t need a meditation cushion or bench, or any sort of special equipment to access your mindfulness skills—but you do need to set aside some time and space. <br> 2. <u>Observe the present moment as it is</u>.
            The aim of mindfulness is not quieting the mind, or attempting to achieve a state of eternal calm. The goal is simple: we’re aiming to pay attention to the present moment, without judgment. Easier said than done, we know. <br> 3. <u>Let your
                judgments roll by</u>. When we notice judgments arise during our practice, we can make a mental note of them, and let them pass. <br>4. <u>Return to observing the present moment as it is</u>. Our minds often get carried away in thought.
            That’s why mindfulness is the practice of returning, again and again, to the present moment. <br>5. <u>Be kind to your wandering mind</u>. Don’t judge yourself for whatever thoughts crop up, just practice recognizing when your mind has wandered
            off, and gently bring it back.
